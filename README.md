# Conway's Game of Life
This is my implementation of the tutorial [here](https://kylewbanks.com/blog/tutorial-opengl-with-golang-part-1-hello-opengl).
There isn't much different between my implementation and the tutorial, except that I did some other things with it like implement random colors each time a cell comes alive.
